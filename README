UNIX command-line only

 Usage : replvim.sh [options] replname code_type file

Runs a screen/vim session on the given file so that one window
holds a repl and another window holds vim. 
Hit:
<leader>e    to eval the current expression 
<leader>r     to evaluate the given marked range
<leader>f     to evaluate the whole file
ctrl-a <TAB>  to switch windows to the repl 
ctrl-a \      to exit everything 
Set the leader in vim with 
:let mapleader = "," 
replacing "," with the key you like the most

Arguments (wrap these in an alias or sh script):
 replname   The repl being used (ocaml, bigloo, chicken have been tested)
 code_type  Can be 'lisp' for lisp-like or 'ocaml' 
 file               The file for vim to edit

Options:
 --lines n   Use n lines of screen space for the repl
 --nopipe   Use files instead of pipes. This can be used when vim 6.3
                    gives FSYNC errors when writing to pipes on some OSes.
 --echo      Echo the commands being sent to the repl and allow access
                   to them in the readline history

Requires (on your PATH):
  socat (http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/)
  screen (http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
if you don't have these your life will be much richer for obtaining them
